# MSLK Library


MSLK (Meta Superintelligence Labs Kernels, formerly known as **[FBGEMM GenAI](https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai)**)
is a collection of high-performance kernels and optimizations built on top of PyTorch
primitives for GenAI training and inference.

## **Installation**

```bash
# Install MSLK for CUDA
pip install mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
# Install MSLK for ROCm
pip install mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm7.1/
# Install MSLK for CPU (Windows and Linux)
pip install mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# Install a nightly CUDA version
pip install --pre mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130
# Install a nightly ROCm version
pip install --pre mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.1/
# Install a nightly CPU version
pip install --pre mslk --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

## Release Compatibility Table

MSLK is released in accordance to the PyTorch release schedule, and each
release has no guarantee to work in conjunction with PyTorch releases that are
older than the one that the MSLK release corresponds to.

| MSLK Release | Corresponding PyTorch Release | Supported Python Versions | Supported CUDA Versions | Supported CUDA Architectures | Supported ROCm Versions | Supported ROCm Architectures |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.2.0 | 2.12.x | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 | 13.0, 13.2 | 8.0, 9.0a, 10.0a, 12.0a | 7.1, 7.2 | gfx942 |
| 1.1.0 | 2.11.x | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 | 12.6, 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 | 8.0, 9.0a, 10.0a, 12.0a | 7.0, 7.1 | gfx908, gfx90a, gfx942, gfx950 |
| 1.0.0 | 2.10.x | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 | 12.6, 12.8, 12.9, 13.0 | 8.0, 9.0a, 10.0a, 12.0a | 7.1, 7.2 | gfx908, gfx90a, gfx942, gfx950 |

Note that the supported CUDA/ROCm Architectures refer to compiled C++ kernels. In addition, some kernels (e.g. CUTLASS/CK) would be specific to certain architectures. Python JIT DSL based kernels (e.g. Triton) would potentially work on wider variety of architectures.

## **Running Benchmarks**
```bash
python bench/gemm/gemm_bench.py --M 4096 --N 4096 --K 4096
python bench/quantize/quantize_bench.py --M 4096 --K 4096
python bench/conv/conv_bench.py
```

## **Running Tests**
```bash
pytest test/gemm/gemm_test.py
pytest test/quantize/fp8_quantize_correctness_test.py
pytest test/conv/conv_test.py
```

## **Windows CPU Wheel**

Windows CPU wheels are supported and verified on Python 3.11 and 3.12. See
[Windows wheel builds](docs/windows_build.md) for full build instructions.

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel build
python -m pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py --build-variant cpu bdist_wheel
```

## **Build From Source**
The upstream build is Linux-oriented. This fork also tracks Windows CPU and CUDA
wheel build support; see [Windows wheel builds](docs/windows_build.md).
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/meta-pytorch/MSLK
cd MSLK
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
# Build and install
# The script will create a conda environment and install the required dependencies.
# The conda environment will look something like: build-py3.14-torchnightly-cuda12.9.1
./ci/integration/mslk_oss_build.bash
# After the initial environment setup, you can activate the environment and iterate faster:
conda activate build-py3.14-torchnightly-cuda12.9.1
python setup.py install
```

### **Python-Only Build**
If you don't need the C++/CUDA kernels (e.g. for testing Python only changes), you can install MSLK in Python-only mode by setting the `MSLK_PYTHON_ONLY` environment variable. This skips the C++/CUDA compilation entirely.
```bash
MSLK_PYTHON_ONLY=1 pip install -e .
```
